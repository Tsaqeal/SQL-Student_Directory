# SQL Student Analytics Project

Welcome to my SQL Student Analytics project! This repository demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases, write complex SQL queries, and perform data analysis. The project focuses on creating and managing tables for student data, analyzing attendance and performance, and generating meaningful insights.

This project showcases my expertise in database design, data manipulation, and analysis using SQL.

---

## Project Objectives

### Data Management
- Create and manage relational tables for students in Physics1 and Maths1 classes.
- Use data from a central directory (`student_directory`) to populate class-specific tables.

### Data Analysis
- Calculate attendance percentages and project scores.
- Compute certification scores for students based on weighted metrics.
- Compare and rank students across different classes.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- **SQL Proficiency**: Table creation, data population, and advanced querying.
- **Data Analysis**: Use of calculated fields to derive insights such as certification scores.
- **Relational Database Design**: Joining multiple tables and organizing data effectively.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Translating business logic (e.g., certification scoring) into efficient SQL queries.

---

## Features

### Relational Table Design
- **Physics1Learners**: Stores weekly attendance and project scores for Physics1 students.
- **Maths1Learners**: Stores the same for Maths1 students.

### Dynamic Data Generation
- Randomized attendance percentages and project scores to simulate real-world data.

### Certification Score Calculation
Combines attendance and project scores using the formula:

- Certification Score = (Average Attendance * 0.4) 
                      + (First & Second Project Scores * 0.3) 
                      + (Final Project Score * 0.3)

## Features

### Table Creation
- **Physics1Learners**: Contains weekly attendance percentages and project scores for Physics1 students.
- **Maths1Learners**: Contains similar data for Maths1 students.
- **Below** is the code that you would use to create the tables for Physics1 and Maths1 students, import the data from the student_directory table, and perform various analyses as mentioned. 

```text
-- Select the database you are using (assuming 'importcsv' in this case)
USE importcsv;

-- Create the Physics1Learners table to store Physics students data
CREATE TABLE Physics1Learners (
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Surname VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Week1_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Week2_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Week3_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Week4_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    First_Project_Score INT,
    Second_Project_Score INT,
    Final_Project_Score INT
);

-- Create the Maths1Learners table to store Maths students data
CREATE TABLE Maths1Learners (
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Surname VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Week1_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Week2_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Week3_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Week4_Attendance DECIMAL(5, 2),
    First_Project_Score INT,
    Second_Project_Score INT,
    Final_Project_Score INT
);

-- Populate Physics1Learners table with random data from student_directory where class is 'Physics1'
INSERT INTO Physics1Learners (Name, Surname, Email, Week1_Attendance, Week2_Attendance, Week3_Attendance, Week4_Attendance, First_Project_Score, Second_Project_Score, Final_Project_Score)
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Surname, 
    Email,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week1_Attendance,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week2_Attendance,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week3_Attendance,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week4_Attendance,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 100) + 1 AS First_Project_Score,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 100) + 1 AS Second_Project_Score,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 100) + 1 AS Final_Project_Score
FROM student_directory
WHERE Class = 'Physics1';

-- Populate Maths1Learners table with random data from student_directory where class is 'Maths1'
INSERT INTO Maths1Learners (Name, Surname, Email, Week1_Attendance, Week2_Attendance, Week3_Attendance, Week4_Attendance, First_Project_Score, Second_Project_Score, Final_Project_Score)
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Surname, 
    Email,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week1_Attendance,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week2_Attendance,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week3_Attendance,
    ROUND(RAND() * 100, 2) AS Week4_Attendance,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 100) + 1 AS First_Project_Score,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 100) + 1 AS Second_Project_Score,
    FLOOR(RAND() * 100) + 1 AS Final_Project_Score
FROM student_directory
WHERE Class = 'Maths1';

```


  























### Certification Score Calculation
The certification score is calculated using the formula:


Certification Score = (Average Attendance * 0.4) 
                      + (First & Second Project Scores * 0.3) 
                      + (Final Project Score * 0.3).
